KDbg Release Notes for version 2.5.4
====================================

Changes since 2.5.3
-------------------

Bug fixes

- Source file names with international characters are handled better.

- When an executable is loaded, GDBs of different vintage print different
  text, some of which were treated as error text incorrectly, leading to
  failed debugging sessions. More of these texts are now ignored.

- Variables pointing to some global variable lacked the ability to be
  expanded with recent GDBs.

- Parsing of string values residing in global variables was fixed.
