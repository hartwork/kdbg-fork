KDbg Release Notes for version 2.5.5
====================================

Changes since 2.5.4
-------------------

Bug fixes

- A crash when the hotkey settings are changed was fixed.

- The animation button was regenerated to avoid a crash with modern Qt.
  Thanks to Armin Felder for the initial fix.

- Pretty-printers and GDB Python extensions were disabled, because they
  would interfere with the output parser.

- Recent GDBs do not terminate on receipt of SIGTERM, keeping KDbg
  running for 20 seconds. This was fixed.
