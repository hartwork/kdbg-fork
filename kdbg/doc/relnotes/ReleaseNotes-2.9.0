Enhancements

Bug fixes

- Line breaks of status bar messages produced by GDB are now trimmed
  to avoid that the text is only visible partially. Fix by Gilles Allard.

- (Action and application) icons are installed in an application neutral
  location because the launcher menu of modern KDE desktops does not show
  the icon otherwise.

- Fixed a typo in the pretty-printer of std::vector<>.
