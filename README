This is KDbg, a graphical user interface around GDB using
KDE, the K Desktop Environment.

To build and install:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DBUILD_FOR_KDE_VERSION=6 ..
	make
	sudo make install

It may be necessary to tell the install location explicitly,
then use, for example,

	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DBUILD_FOR_KDE_VERSION=6 ..

The KDE header files libraries must be available. Make sure
that the development packages are installed. To build for the older
version 5 of the KDE Framework, use

	cmake -DBUILD_FOR_KDE_VERSION=5 ..
